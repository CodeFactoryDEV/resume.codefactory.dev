# Lyndon Michael Bibera [UPDATED 2021-08-14]
A highly-independent and broad-scoped software engineering practitioner who has various experiences with leading, building, and supporting various applications in a variety of industry domains. Ultimately, his goal is to be a professional in Cloud Architecture and engineering with a specialization in developing AI-enabled applications.  

## Experience

## Cloud Architect - TalentScout Inc. (headhuntr.io)
Initially started as a part-time consultant for setting up the Infrastructure and development workflow. Worked full-time a few months later after I singlehandedly configured the AWS infrastructure and development workflow for the new project. 

I spend 80% of my developer time doing the backend (Spring Boot, Java) side, the rest is spent is for making sure our infrastructure is prod-ready - monitoring, alarms, right-sizing, security.

Job is decent, zero overtime and our primary boss comes from a technical background so I don‚Äôt have difficulties explaining the issues.

Lesson learned: don‚Äôt write code if you don‚Äôt have to + automate everything 

Buzzwords: AWS Infrastructure, DevOps, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, API Platform, Spring, Scala, Java, Groovy, Python, React, Terraform, Helm, Sagemaker, Tensorflow, Keras, EKS, Kubernetes, Bitbucket Pipelines, Docker, Postgres, Elasticsearch, QA Automation, RestAssured, Allure, Selenide, Selenium Grid, Spock, iOS, SwiftUI, UIKit, Redis, RabbitMQ, WebSocket

## Senior Software Engineer / Team lead - ING Business Shared Services (Bills Payment)
A typical day starts with an department-wide status meeting for team leads, planning and consultation with architects, and the occasional meeting with non-tech stakeholders. 

The worst days include having to solve a P1 issue, and having to stay all night until you figured out the problem.

Huge company (200+, tech people), and a ton of micro-services in the backend to support a mobile banking application plus some back-office applications.

Career-wise, this has got to be the best job ever. Awesome team, great managers, spared no expense at our machines üçé

Main Tech: Java, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Spring Data JPA (MSSQL)

Other stuffs: API Design, Mentorship, Code Reviews, Candidate Interviews

Lesson learned: big organizations are really hard to run, be patient and make sure to produce top-quality code


## Senior Software Engineer - Bolton International (KWL)
‚Ä¢ Spearheaded the transition to distributed data processing using Apache Spark (Scala) and EMR to enable massive data processing, resulting in 100x improvement in terms of speed and scalability resulting in significant savings in infrastructure cost while enabling us to process data volumes which we initially thought were impossible
‚Ä¢ Initiated the move away from standard JEE and into Spring Boot micro services to improve development speed and enable us to apply modern software engineering best practices, reducing the rate of regression bugs and improved developer agility
‚Ä¢ Modernised our public-facing REST APIs by adopting domain-oriented and test-driven API designs through the use of CQRS, Spring HATEOAS, Spring REST Docs and Spring MVC Tests, resulting in increased productivity, fast-evolving APIs, up-to-date and relevant documentations
‚Ä¢ Improved scalability and resiliency of backend workers by re-engineering the monolithic worker in smaller micro services orchestrated by Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
‚Ä¢ Upgraded the authentication and authorization modules by moving to Spring Security OAuth2 (JWT), greatly improving security and finally freed us from the session issue we have experienced due to the stateful nature of the previous auth module which we temporarily dealt with using ELB sticky sessions
‚Ä¢ Automated the provisioning of the runtime infrastructure through the use of Cloudformation, easing the process of setting up new environments
‚Ä¢ Enhanced the tool belts of fellow engineers by teaching them PySpark to deal with massive amounts of data

Lesson learned: ideas should be grounded in reality

## Senior Software Engineer - Diversify OSS (Miiingle)
‚Ä¢ Launched a mobile application on TechCrunch
‚Ä¢ Mainly worked on the backend application using Spring MVC
‚Ä¢ EmberJS and Bootstrap for back-office/marketing team user interface
‚Ä¢ Google Cloud Platform as the runtime (App Engine, Cloud Storage)
‚Ä¢ Android and iOS public-facing user interface 
‚Ä¢ Geo-spatial techniques using regular databases
‚Ä¢ Social media integration to access user profile
‚Ä¢ Google Analytics to observe user behaviour
